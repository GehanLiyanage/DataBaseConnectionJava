# DataBaseConnection

## Overview

The `DataBaseConnectionJava` class in this project provides a simple and efficient way to establish and manage connections to a database using Java. It is designed to handle connection pooling, making database interactions more efficient and less resource-intensive.

## Features

- Establish connection to a database
- Connection pooling for efficient resource management
- Simple configuration using properties file
- Support for multiple database types (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Exception handling for database operations

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- JDBC driver for your database (e.g., MySQL Connector/J for MySQL databases)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- JDBC driver for your specific database

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GehanLiyanage/DataBaseConnectionJava.git
    cd DatabaBeConnectionJava
    ```

2. **Add the JDBC driver to your project:**

   Download the JDBC driver for your database and add it to your project's classpath. For example, for a MySQL database, download the MySQL Connector/J and place the JAR file in the `lib` directory.
